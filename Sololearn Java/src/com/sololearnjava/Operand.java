    Java arithmetic operators:
    + addition
    - subtraction
    * multiplication
    / division
    % modulo
    Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same way that they are used in algebraic equations.
    In the example above, the result of the division equation will be a whole number, as int is used as the data type.
     You can use double to retrieve a value with a decimal point.
     The modulo (or remainder) math operation performs an integer division of one value by another, and returns the remainder of that division.
     The operator for the modulo operation is the percentage (%) character.

    /*

    An increment or decrement operator provides a more convenient and compact way to increase or decrease the value of a variable by one.
    For example, the statement x=x+1; can be simplified to ++x;
     */
    /*
    The decrement operator (--) is used to decrease the value of a variable by one.
     */
    /*
    You are allowed to define an empty string. For example, String str = "";
       The + (plus) operator between strings adds them together to make a new string. This process is called concatenation.
        The resulted string is the first string put together with the second string.
        The char data type represents a single character.
